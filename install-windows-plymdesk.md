# Installing RStudio
_Ben Whalley, Peter Jones, Andy Wills, June 2018._

These instructions are for Plymouth University staff who are using a **university-owned Windows** laptop or desktop. This version  is slightly older than the ones we plan to use in 2018/19, so you may notice some differences relative to the teaching materials. We'll get this fixed before the new academic year begins.

To install, go to :

`Start menu > Microsoft System Center > Software Center`

and intsall "R_3.4.1" and RStudio 1.0.153". You may have to click several times to ignore error messages that say "Failed to expand shell folder userdocs".
